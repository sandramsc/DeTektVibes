<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About 

Planet earth has been around and evolving for centuries, the surface of the earth is always in constant motion. Although slow for humans to see, sense or feel the tectonic plates moving in slow motion sometimes get stuck and cause friction when they shift against each other. This is when we (humans) start to get a sense of what might be happening at the center of the earth. This sudden friction and tention on the edges of these plates cause sudden "earthquakes", tremors that we end up feeling on the surface of the earth. It is thus become important for us to come up with effective ways to monitor, detect these vibrations and earthquaukes inorder to come up with more effective wys to reduce the damage that might be causeed by them. This application demonstrates one of the ways we can study earthquake data by visualizing it on a global map as they have occured in the past day.

How:
* The application dashboard contains a panel on the left with a button, when clicked on navigates to the location that is saturated with earthquakes.
* The global map is centered and renders to display the earthquakes that occured in the past day

### Built With

* [Openlayers](https://openlayers.org/)
* [Earthquake data from USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
